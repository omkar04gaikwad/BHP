Part 1: Express the optimization problem that needs to be solved to determine the MAP estimate of the vehicle position.

Let the true position of the vehicle be denoted by $x_0 = [x_{0}, y_{0}]^T$, and the position of the $i$th reference point be denoted by $p_i = [p_{ix}, p_{iy}]^T$. Let the candidate vehicle position under consideration be denoted by $x = [x, y]^T$.

Assuming that the range measurements are independent and Gaussian with mean $||p_i - x||$ and standard deviation $\sigma_r$, the likelihood function for the range measurements can be written as:

$$p(z_1,\dots,z_K|x_0) = \prod_{i=1}^{K}\mathcal{N}(z_i; ||p_i - x||, \sigma_r^2)$$

where $z_i$ is the $i$th range measurement.

Assuming that the prior on the vehicle position is a Gaussian with mean $x_{0}$ and covariance matrix $R$, the prior distribution can be written as:

$$p(x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_0; \mu, R)$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the prior distribution.

The MAP estimate of the vehicle position can be obtained by maximizing the posterior distribution:

$$p(x_0|z_1,\dots,z_K) = \frac{p(z_1,\dots,z_K|x_0)p(x_0)}{p(z_1,\dots,z_K)}$$

Since the denominator is a normalization constant, it can be ignored for the purpose of optimization. Thus, the optimization problem can be written as:

$$\max_{x_0} \log(p(z_1,\dots,z_K|x_0)p(x_0))$$

Expanding the squared terms and simplifying the objective function, we get:
